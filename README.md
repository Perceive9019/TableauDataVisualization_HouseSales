## Data Visualizations and Analysis
The King County, Washington House dataset was used for the following purposes:

- **Daily Average House Sales**:
    - The line plot of Daily Average Sales Prices of Houses Over Time captures the average number of houses sold daily. This line plot provides an overview of the overall market activity and reveals patterns in demand and supply over time. By analyzing trends in daily sales, we can identify periods of high activity and low activity in home sales which can inform home purchasing behavior and market forecasts.
- **Map: Visualizing Spatial House Sales**:
    - The Map offers a visual representation of house sales data superimposed on a geographical map. This visualization allows us to identify geographical patterns in sales activity, such as areas with higher or lower numbers of house sales. By analyzing the map, we can gain insights into how location, neighborhood, proximity,  and amenities influence house prices.
- **Distribution House Prices**: 
    - The histogram showing the Distribution of House Prices provides a graphical representation that helps identify the range of house prices and median prices. This information is important for understanding the overall affordability of houses and return on investment in a given zipcode.
- **Household Composition: Distribution of Bedroom**:
    - The Distribution of Bedrooms reveals the breakdown of houses by the number of bedrooms. This information provides insights into the types of households typically found in the area which gives insight into different family sizes. By analyzing the distribution, we can identify areas with larger or smaller homes, which can influence the overall housing market by appealing to specific buyer demographics.
- **Household Composition: Distribution of Bathrooms**:
    - The Distribution of bathrooms provides a breakdown of houses by the number of bathrooms. This information is important for assessing the functionality of the properties, particularly for families with multiple members. In analyzing the distribution, we can identify areas with a higher concentration of homes with more bathrooms, which may appeal to large families.
